# dynamic-token
To make a secure and sensitive API request with a dynamic token, you need to ensure that the request is originating from your app. This is necessary because many proxy browsers do not support cross-origin requests, and apps like Postman do not have an origin. To achieve this, you can use a dynamic token feature when the anyone accesses a sensitive feature like login ,signup or verfiyOTP etc.\
